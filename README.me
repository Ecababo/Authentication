# Kubernetes Authentication

This repository is part of a personal project to learn the basics of Kubernetes and Docker in a CI/CD environment. It simulates a RADIUS-like service that validates usernames and passwords, returning appropriate HTTP responses. The project provides a hands-on exploration of container orchestration and service interaction within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview
### Key Components
#### Python Scripts:
- RADIUS Service Simulation: A Python script that acts as a RADIUS-like service. It validates username and password payloads, returning appropriate HTTP status codes based on the authentication result.
- Client Simulation: A Python script that simulates a client attempting to connect to the RADIUS service using random username-password combinations.
- Docker Integration: Each Python script is containerized using Docker, forming the basis for two separate Docker images. These images are deployed to Kubernetes pods for service orchestration.
- Kubernetes Deployment: A Kubernetes pod hosts the RADIUS service. Multiple client pods are created to simulate concurrent user authentication attempts.

## How it works
- The Client Pod interacts with the RADIUS Service Pod by sending POST requests containing username-password pairs.
Authentication attempts are triggered via a curl command:
```
curl -X POST http://$pod_ip:8080/start_authentication
```
Upon receiving the request, the client begins a loop, attempting to authenticate every 2 seconds using random credentials from a predefined source file. 

## Next steps
###Planned Enhancements
- ** Error Handling:
Improve logging and exception management for edge cases, such as service unavailability or malformed requests.

- ** Metrics and Monitoring:
Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor authentication success rates and system performance.

- ** CI/CD Pipeline:
Automate the build, test, and deployment of the Docker images and Kubernetes resources.
Database Integration:
Replace the static credential source file with a database-backed solution for dynamic user management.

- ** Scalability:
Test and optimize the Kubernetes deployment for scalability under high traffic.
